ShipShape is a free application designed for accessing Apple's App Store Connect API. This project aims to simplify interactions with the API, making it easier for developers to manage their apps.

## Overview

ShipShape began as a project during a [Hacking with Swift+ live stream](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/live-streams/shipshape). The idea was to create a tool that could read and write data from the App Store Connect API. The project is now open source, allowing the community to contribute and enhance its capabilities.

Our goal is to develop a comprehensive app that fully interacts with the App Store Connect API. We want to create a powerful tool that is accessible to everyone, enabling developers to manage their apps more effectively.
